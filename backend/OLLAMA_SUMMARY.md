# Ollama Integration Summary

## Completed Tasks

### Backend

1. ✅ Created enhanced `OllamaClient` class in separate module (`ollama_client.py`)
   - Added improved error handling for connection issues
   - Implemented response caching to reduce API calls
   - Added detailed status reporting and statistics
   - Added model management features (listing, switching, pulling)

2. ✅ Updated backend.py to use the new OllamaClient implementation
   - Modified imports to use the new module
   - Removed the old OllamaClient implementation

3. ✅ Enhanced API endpoints for Ollama
   - `/ollama/models` - List all models with statistics
   - `/ollama/model` - Set the current model with auto-pull support
   - `/ollama/toggle` - Enable or disable Ollama use
   - `/ollama/pull` - Added new endpoint to pull models from repository

4. ✅ Updated ask endpoints to use Ollama preference
   - Modified `/ask` endpoint to respect `use_ollama` parameter
   - Modified `/ask_with_files` endpoint to respect `use_ollama` form field  

5. ✅ Added testing and documentation
   - Created `test_ollama.py` script to test the integration
   - Created `OLLAMA_USAGE.md` with detailed usage instructions
   - Updated `requirements.txt` with new dependencies

### Frontend

1. ✅ Created UI component for Ollama settings
   - `components/ui/ollama-settings-panel.tsx` - React component for settings
   - Allows toggling Ollama use
   - Allows selecting and pulling models
   - Shows status and statistics

2. ✅ Created frontend integration guide
   - `FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md` with guidelines for frontend team
   - Example code for integrating Ollama settings
   - Guidelines to update API route to forward Ollama preference

## Pending Tasks

1. ⬜ Test all new endpoints with actual Ollama server
   - Test model switching
   - Test API calls with different models
   - Measure performance for different query types

2. ⬜ Integrate the Ollama settings panel into the main UI
   - Add settings page or sidebar
   - Connect Ollama toggle to chat interface

3. ⬜ Add more robust error handling
   - Handle specific error types more gracefully
   - Add retries for temporary connection issues

4. ⬜ Implement performance monitoring
   - Track response times for different models
   - Compare Ollama vs Grok API performance
   - Add usage metrics

5. ⬜ Optimize model parameters
   - Fine-tune temperature and max_tokens settings
   - Test different models with domain-specific content
   - Consider prompt engineering techniques

## Next Steps

1. Run the Ollama test script to verify the implementation works:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python test_ollama.py
   ```

2. Start the backend server and test the API endpoints:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn backend:app --reload
   ```

3. Have the frontend team integrate the OllamaSettingsPanel component following the integration guide.

4. Run a comprehensive comparison between responses from Ollama and Grok for common Tunisie Telecom questions.

5. Update the main README with information about the Ollama integration.
